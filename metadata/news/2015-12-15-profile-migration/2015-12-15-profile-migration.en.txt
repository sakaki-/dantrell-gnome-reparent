Good news! Dantrell B., the GNOME patchset's primary author, is now providing
'extended' profiles for each of GNOME 3.14, 3.16 and 3.18. These profiles
provide a close USE-flag match to their familiar Gentoo desktop/gnome
cousins, and (happily!) make the dantrell-gnome-reparent profiles redundant.

As such, users of any of the dantrell-gnome-reparent profiles should migrate
to the corresponding 'extended' Dantrell profile as soon as possible.

For example, if you were using
dantrell-gnome-reparent:default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/3.14, you
should sync all your overlays, then issue:

# eselect profile set "dantrell-gnome:default/amd64/3.14/extended"
# emerge --ask --verbose --deep --with-bdeps=y --newuse --update @world

Many thanks to everyone who has used the 'reparent' overlays and
provided feedback!

Please note that while I will leave dantrell-gnome-reparent up on GitHub
for historical interest, as of now I am no longer actively developing it.

Any questions, feel free to email me!
